# UniRanked

Objective: Help students understand their likelihood of admission to specific universities, based on real, verified data from past applicants.

**User flow (simplified):**

1. A student **submits** their application info (grades, GPA, SAT/ACT, location, major, universities applied to, accepted/rejected list).
2. Data goes into an **anonymous public database**.
3. Other users can **search or filter** (e.g., “CS at Stanford”, “from India”, “GPA 3.9”) to see aggregate trends — acceptance rates by stat range, geography, etc.

# Basic Roadmap

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Planning & Setup** | 1 week | Repo setup, CI/CD, linting, theming |
| **2. Core Pages** | 2 weeks | Home, Submit, University pages |
| **3. State & Backend Integration** | 2 weeks | Redux Toolkit + Firebase |
| **4. Visualization & Filters** | 2 weeks | AG Grid + charts |
| **5. Testing & Documentation** | 1 week | Jest, docs, Storybook |
| **6. Beta Launch** | 1 week | Deploy to Vercel + collect feedback |

# Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript | Strong typing + scalability |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit | Enterprise-grade global state |
| **UI Library** | MUI (Material UI) | Consistent + accessible design system |
| **Tables** | AG Grid | Powerful for filtering & sorting results |
| **Internationalization** | i18next | Multi-language support |
| **Backend (MVP)** | Firebase or Supabase | Simple hosted backend for now |
| **Testing** | Jest + React Testing Library | Unit & component testing |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (frontend) + Firebase (backend) | Scalable, low DevOps overhead |
| **Docs** | TypeDoc + Markdown (or Storybook for components) | Developer & contributor docs |

## 5. UI / UX Design Overview

You could create a quick Figma mock, but here’s the conceptual flow:

### **Home Page**

- Search bar for universities
- “Top Trending Universities” table
- CTA: “Submit your own results”

### **Submission Form Page**

- Form inputs (GPA, test scores, country, major)
- Multi-select for universities with result toggles
- Validation and success feedback
- Anonymous submission disclaimer

### **University Page**

- Summary stats (acceptance rate, average GPA)
- AG Grid for detailed submissions
- Filters (country, major, GPA range)
- Charts (GPA distribution, acceptances by region)

# Data Model

```jsx
type Submission = {
  id: string;
  gpa: number;
  country: string;
  major: string;
  testScores?: {
    sat?: number;
    act?: number;
  };
  applications: {
    university: string;
    result: 'Accepted' | 'Rejected' | 'Waitlisted';
  }[];
  createdAt: string;
};

```
